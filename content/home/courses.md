##### Introduction to Software and Systems Engineering

[2019-2](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/Mzc0MjkzOTA0ODBa), ..., 2014-2 
(please email or chat for class code)

> An undergraduate level course introducing basic software engineering concepts, activities (requirements management, configuration management, project management, testing, design and implementation, refactoring), techniques, and tools. This is a very practical, hands-on, course exploring in detail a single technique and tool for each activity, instead of overviewing a number of techniques and tools for each activity. The techniques and tools are applied in the context of software as a service, using Typescript, Angular, and Node.js. As learning these technologies is not the main focus of the course, we simply overview them. 


##### Code Integration Tools and Techniques

[2019-2](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/Mzc0NzYxMjU0NDNa)
(please email or chat for class code)

> An advanced undergraduate and graduate level course discussing code integration tools and techniques, including different kinds of merge tools (textual, syntactic, semantic), continuous integration and deployment, and integration conflict prediction. We discuss a number of research papers and technical blog posts, and students execute an empirical study to either replicate the discussed studies or answer related research questions.
